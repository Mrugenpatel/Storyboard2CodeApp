# Storybard2CodeApp
Mac app that converts an iOS storyboard into code. Work in progress.

# Progress
## Rudimentary support
- [x] UIView
- [x] UIButton
- [x] UILabel
- [x] UITextField
- [x] UISegmentedControl
- [x] UISlider

# Usage
At the moment, all the elements in the storyboard need a label because this is used for the name of the element. You can set the label in the identity inspector:

At the moment, the app will crash when a label is missing. But you will see an error output on the console.
